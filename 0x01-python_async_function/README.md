## Resources:books:
### Read or watch:
* [Async IO in Python: A Complete Walkthrough](https://realpython.com/async-io-python/)
* [asyncio - Asynchronous I/O](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html)
* [random.uniform](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.uniform)

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/), without the help of Google:
### General
* ```async``` and ```await``` syntax
* How to execute an async program with ``` asyncio```
* How to run concurrent coroutines
* How to create ```asyncio``` tasks
* How to use the ```random``` module

## Requirements
* A ```README.md``` file.

## Tasks
* [x] 0. The basics of async
* [x] 1. Let's execute multiple coroutines at the same time with async
* [x] 2. Measure the runtime
* [x] 3. Import wait_random from 0-basic_async_syntax.
* [x] 4. Take the code from wait_n and alter it into a new function task_wait_n. The code is nearly identical to wait_n     
          except task_wait_random is being called.
